v1.1
- Fixed issue with FAR where FAR's dynamic control adjustment would get overriden
- Fixed trim issues
- Added wheel throttle and wheel steer
- Fixed a bug where throttle wouldn't go below 50%
- Support for controller hats both as axes and buttons (new "Treat hats as buttons" config option)
- Fixed SDL plug and play
- Fixed a preset editor bug where if time is slowed down (e.g. by using the TimeScale mod),
it was not possible to change bindings
- Large refactoring and optimization of the code base
- Breaks the configuration XML, you will need to recreate your presets. This will be avoided in the future by providing automatic
conversion between old and new format configs, but it's not possible for this version.
